# Quick Test Instructions

## Immediate Testing (Without Database Setup)

Your chatbot should work right now with these steps:

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test the Chat
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/simple
2. Sign in with Clerk
3. Start chatting - it should work immediately!

The app will automatically use "Simple Mode" (no conversation history) until you set up the database.

## For Full Features (Conversation History + Sidebar)

### 1. Set Up Supabase Database
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Open your project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dfubyvplzppqhjbetquh
3. Go to SQL Editor (left sidebar)
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `database-setup.sql`
5. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

### 2. Test Full Features
1. After running the SQL, restart your dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/chat
3. You should see the sidebar with conversation history!

## Troubleshooting

### If Chat Doesn't Respond:
- Check your OpenAI API key in `.env`
- Make sure you're signed in with Clerk
- Check browser console for errors

### If Database Features Don't Work:
- Make sure you ran the SQL in Supabase
- Check if tables exist in Supabase dashboard
- Go to `/debug` page to test connections

### If Nothing Works:
- Check all environment variables in `.env`
- Restart the development server
- Check the browser console for errors
